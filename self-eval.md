# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  - _It was definitely a bit challenging, especially the last question. I unproductively struggled at one point and had to step away. I'm not totally sure my answer is what you're looking for, but I was happy I was able to figure out the solution that I did. It took me awhile to get there._
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  - _Pretty good really. I'm blocking off plenty of time, so I haven't really ran into any issues._
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  - _I don't think I need anything other than to mentally prepare. My work setup is great and I feel good about my available time. Like I said, I just need to mentally prepare for longer days of this. Looking forward to only focusing on Turing though, and being done with my current job._
